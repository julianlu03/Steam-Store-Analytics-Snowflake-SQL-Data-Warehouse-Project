# Steam Store Analytics - Snowflake SQL Data Warehouse Project
End-to-end Snowflake data warehouse for 27K+ Steam games using medallion architecture, dimensional modeling, and Snowflake-native AI features.

**Execution Environment**
All data transformations were implemented using a Snowflake-native SQL notebook, allowing queries to execute directly within Snowflake’s compute environment. This mirrors real-world Snowflake workflows where notebooks are used for exploratory analysis, pipeline prototyping, and analytics development without external orchestration tools.
